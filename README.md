C++ Timeouts
============

A portable, header-only C++11 timer component.

It manages a set of timeouts that, when expired, invoke a callback. It uses
features of C++11 in order to avoid platform specific code.

It supports one-shot and periodic timeouts.

Documentation
-------------

Please see the documentation in [cpptime.h](./cpptime.h) for more detailed information about
the implementation.

Implementation Status
---------------------

This is a new component and not much testing has been done. We already use it
in some of our products but expect that it receives some updates over time.

Possible Features
----------------

While the current implementation serves us well, there are some features that
might potentially be interesting for other use cases. Contact us in case you
are interested.

- [x] Ability to have multiple timer components running.
- [x] Distribute it as a header only library.
- [ ] Optionally avoid locking.
- [ ] API to use client thread instead of creating its own.
- [ ] API to use client mutex instead of its own.

Use Cases and Limitations
-------------------------

Naturally the implementation makes some trade-offs. This makes it useful for
some cases, and less so for others.

- The timer runs completely in user space. This makes it slightly less efficient
than other solutions, such as `timer_create()` or `timerfd_create()`. However,
in many cases, this overhead is acceptable.

- Given a C++11 capable compiler, the code is portable.

- The API to add or remove a timeout is arguably nicer than the platform specific
alternatives. E.g.

~~~
timer.add(seconds(2), [](CppTime::timer_id) { ... });
~~~

- Please note: the callback function's state (e.g., lambda function captured
variables) are not accessible after calling timer.remove(), including if it's
removed from inside the callback function itself. This is because the timer
event has been removed, and has become invalid

- The implementation is small and easy to understand. It is not difficult to
change to make it better suitable for specific cases.

Examples
--------

A one shot timer.

~~~
using namespace std::chrono;
CppTime::Timer t;
t.add(seconds(2), [](CppTime::timer_id) { std::cout << "yes\n"; });
std::this_thread::sleep_for(seconds(3));
~~~

A periodic timer that is first executed after 2 seconds, and after this every
second. The event is removed after 10 seconds.

~~~
using namespace std::chrono;
CppTime::Timer t;
auto id = t.add(seconds(2), [](CppTime::timer_id) { std::cout << "yes\n"; }, seconds(1));
std::this_thread::sleep_for(seconds(10));
t.remove(id);
~~~

See the tests for more examples.


Usage
-----

To use the timer component, Simply copy [cpptime.h](./cpptime.h) into you
project. Everything is contained in this single header file.

Tests can be compiled and executed with the following commands, assuming you
are on a POSIX machine.

~~~
g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -o test tests/timer_test.cpp -l pthread
./test
~~~
